  - Regional breakdown by U.S. states

### Step 3: Visual Design (Dashboard Layout)
- Created a one-page dashboard layout in Excel using:
  - **Bar charts** for calls by by response time, call by sentiment, and sentiment by call center
  - **Stacked column charts** for reason for call, call by call center and total inbound calls
  - **Donut chart** for Call by channel distribution including call-center,	chatbot, email, and	web
  - **Map visualization** (using filled-maps) to show calls by state
  - **Slicers** for call day and call center
- Used cell formatting, cell referencings, and labeled sections for easy navigation.
